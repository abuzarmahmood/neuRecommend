![Project Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/300)

## Overview
neuRecommend is a project focused on developing a classifier for semi-automated spike-sorting and channel recommendation. The primary goals are to remove noise during preprocessing to improve clustering and to recommend electrodes with neurons for user convenience.

## Classification Pipeline
- **Classifiers**: Utilizes Random Forest and XGBoost for robust classification.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporates advanced techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Employs PCA and UMAP to reduce feature space while retaining essential information.
- **Model Interpretability**: Includes SHAP analysis for understanding model predictions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Offers grid search capabilities for optimizing model parameters.

## Features
- Utilizes Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers
- Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction
- Model interpretability
